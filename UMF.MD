## How to install uModFramework
Step 1: Finding your files
  - First navigate to the location your file downloaded  
    1. the windows default download location is ``` C:\Users\%UserName%\Downloads ```
  - second in a different window navigate to the installation folder of the game you want to mod
    
I will be modding slime rancher in this example, and will be using the steam version. The default installation for slime rancher through steam is ``` C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Slime Rancher ```

This is what a fresh installation of slime rancher looks like, the contents of your fodler should look similar.

  - next open that folder and run the uModFramework.setup.exe
